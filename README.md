# Console-based-Banking-Application
You are required to design and develop a console-based 
banking application. The application should provide core 
banking functionalities such as account creation, login, 
balance inquiry, and fund transfer. The application must 
15
be efficient in terms of resource utilization and effective 
in meeting user requirements.
Tasks:
Carry out the tasks below 
• Create a GitHub repository and organize your source 
files
Ensure your build meets the requirements below:
Specific Requirements:
Specific Requirements:
• Design:
Create a clear and logical object-oriented design for the 
application, considering classes such as Account, 
Customer, and potentially Bank.
Define attributes and methods for each class, including:
Account: account number, balance, account type 
(savings, current, mortgage), customer ID. Methods: 
deposit, withdraw, transfer, check balance.
Customer: customer ID, name, address, contact 
information. Methods: create account, and view 
accounts.
Bank: bank name, address, contact information. 
Methods: generate account number, validate account 
number, find customer by account number.
Design user interfaces that are intuitive and easy to 
navigate, providing clear prompts and informative 
feedback.
• Development:
Implement the designed classes and methods using 
Python programming language.
Develop core banking functionalities including:
Account creation with automatic account number 
generation.
User login based on account number and appropriate 
authentication.
Balance inquiry for the logged-in account.
Fund transfer between accounts of the same type.
Account information retrieval by account number, 
including customer name and account type.
Ensure efficient use of system resources, such as 
memory and processing power.
Implement error handling and exception handling 
mechanisms to enhance application robustness.
